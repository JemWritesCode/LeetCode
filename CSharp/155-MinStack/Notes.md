https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR_D_KIAYrE Why are Tuples a thing? This is about Python but explains the concepts in a general way.
* Immutable = not changeable. Mutable = changeable. 
* Tuples are almost the same as a list
* At least in python tuple object does not support item assignement. so once set they are immutable. this makes tuples faster to create in python

* But tuples are mutable in C#

* Tuples are lightweight syntax to represent data. Removes complexity of classes and context switching.
