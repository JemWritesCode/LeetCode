Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>`).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

**Example 1:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> [[-2,2]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) &lt; sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> [[3,3],[-2,4]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= k <= points.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
-   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
