// Breadth First Search

// Time Complexity: O(n) (Analyze Complexity Confirmed)
// We have to visit each node once to add it to the queue. And then also dequeue. 
// So O(2N) and remove constant for O(n)

// Space Complexity: O(n) (Analyze Complexity Confirmed)
// Best case is a skewed binary tree with O(1) because each level just enqueue 1 node.
/* Worse case: Perfect Binary Tree: O((nâˆ’1)/2+1) ~ O(n). Imagine there are 7 nodes in the tree. In a perfect binary tree, that would mean 4 nodes on the 3rd level which means the queue will have at most 6/2 + 1 nodes. For 15 nodes, that's 8 nodes on the 4th level, which means the queue will have at most 14/2 + 1 nodes. Regardless, it's still O(n), but could be worth mentioning that you understand the queue never contains more nodes than the max level in a perfect binary tree.
