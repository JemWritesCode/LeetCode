There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10<sup>9</sup>`.

**Example 1:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> m = 3, n = 7
<strong>Output:</strong> 28
```

**Example 2:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> m = 3, n = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -&gt; Down -&gt; Down
2. Down -&gt; Down -&gt; Right
3. Down -&gt; Right -&gt; Down
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
