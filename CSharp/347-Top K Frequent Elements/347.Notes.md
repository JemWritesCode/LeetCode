### Bucket Sort Method
[Neetcode 347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPTqKIgVk-k)
* Explains what Bucket Sort is and how it's used a little less conventionally for this question.
* Use the index for the count and store a list (int array) of numbers of that frequency at that index.
* The number of elements in the counting array is proportionate to the inputArray length


### Priority Queue Method
* [ADT vs CDT](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-difference-between-abstract-concrete-data-types-xecfc#:~:text=An%20abstract%20data%20type%20provides,carried%20out%20in%20a%20particular)
    * An abstract data type (ADT) is a way of describing the behavior and properties of a data type without specifying how it's implemented. For example, a stack is an ADT that defines a data type that supports adding and removing elements in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. However, an ADT does not tell you how to store or access the elements of a stack, or what kind of data it can hold. That is left to the concrete data type.
    * A concrete data type (CDT) is a way of implementing an ADT using a specific data structure and algorithm. For example, you can implement a stack (ADT) using an array or a linked list and use different methods to push and pop elements. A CDT defines how the data is stored in memory, how it is accessed and modified, and what operations are supported. A CDT can also have additional features or constraints that are not part of the ADT.

[Priority Queue by WilliamFiset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wptevk0bshY)
* Priority Queues are abstract data types (ADTs) that operate similar to a normal queue except that **each element has a certain priority.** 
    * Note: Prioritiy queues only support comparable data, meaning the data inserted into the priority queue must be able to be ordered in some way either from least to greatest or greatest to least. This is so we can assign relative priorities to each element. 
* A heap is a tree based data structure that satisfies the **heap invariant** (also called heap property): If A is a parent node of B then A is ordered with respect to B for all nodes A, B in the heap
* This means: the parent node is either always greater than or equal to the child nodes (max heap) or always less than or equal to the child nodes (min heap)
* Both Max Heap and Min Heap are binary heaps
* Sometimes priority queues are called heaps but this isn't technically correct. Priority queues are ADTs and could be implemented with other things than heaps
* Binomial Heaps

[Heaps, heapsort, and priority queues by InsideCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLIajuc31qk)
* Complete Binary Trees are always balanced
* Sift-up and Sift-down time complexity is O(logn)
* Heapify aka Building the Heap. You could receive a tree that isn't respecting the heap property so you can sift down and make sure that it does
* Heapsort is a data structure that heapifies the array that we want to sort then keeps extracting min until it becomes empty
* Priority queues put the highest priority nodes at the front
